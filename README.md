To run notebook - Please make sure to have the csv file in the same location or change the path.

 

To run the production code - Just run "python main.py"


## Projects details are as follows 

### configs :- In this module I defined everything that can be configurable and can be changed in future.

### dataloader :- I defined all dataloading, preprocessing steps in this module

### executor :- This module is responsible for training the model.

### evaluation :- Kept empty for now. Mainly responsible for evaluating the model.

### model :- This module only contains the actual deep learning / machine learning code.

### Experiments :- This directory contains the notebook which I have used for experiments. It is the same notebook attached in this email.

### ops :- Empty as of now. Could be used in future for operational related operations

### utils :- Utility functions that are used in more than one place.

### saved_models :- Saved the model after training.

### main.py :- The entry point of the project.


#### Scope for enhancement are as follows.
1- We may need to use a weighted class for training so that we can achieve a high score.

2- We could use docker containers while productionizing the model.
